# Testcases
Multiple testcases to check the correctness fullfork code
***
1. `test1-4.c` : Routine testing at various instance thread creation.
2. `test5-8.c`:  Testing across exit, sleep and long computation threads.
3. `test9-12.c`: Purpose: Testing functionality across forked child/parent.
4. `test13-15.c`: One of the threads is calling fork.
5. `test16-18.c`: Inside one of the threads, the child is executing fibonacci while the parent is waiting for its completion.

## In order to run the test cases first insert the fullfork module then run the check.sh script.
